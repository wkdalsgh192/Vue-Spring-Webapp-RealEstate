# Service Introduction
Happy House, which is an online real estate agent platform, was created by two young and talented Korean developers in December 2020. At the target of young generation who wants to be cool and hip, this has been made to provide them the most useful experience in looking for various kinds of studios, apartments that they would live in. For that, expectation and anxiety that come from a new living place were set as main keywords that we should deal with in our website. In other words, we wanted them to be more hopeful and less nervous by our numerous services. Because it is a prototype, it will not get updated unless there are major issues. If you have any questions, please shoot an email to deakse@gmail.com.

# UI/UX Design
We set our main color to light pink for better visual convenience. So, tens of logo designs fitted our brans strategy were suggested with the help of Tailer Brands Studio and the current design was finally chosen throguh delicate reviews. Along that, the main page was also changed to the amazing illustration of <b>Gala Poliakova</b>, which looks more natural than just a google-style simple design. She is an great illustrator working for a meditation app company. If you love it, I am 100% sure that her other works would also catch your eyes. Check them out right now on the link. Back to our topic, her illustration.

# Frontend : Vue
  We used the Vue framwork for frontend. Before that, we made web pages to .jsp, that was totally undesiable since all the html and css codes were mingled with java codes. After the installation of Vue CLI, however, we could make our messy files and codes well-organized.
